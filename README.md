# fairhotel-browser-plugin

## Todo:

- research existing solutions
- chrome plugin
- firefox plugin
- does fairhotels.org have an api, or will we have to scrape the data?
- design: where in the Concur booking system should this plugin show its data?
- design: where in the Tripit hotel viewing system should this plugin show its data?

## Disclaimers

I don't know how much time I'll get to spend on this. Probably not that much. Make extensive pull requests and I will merge them. :) I don't have any pre-existing expertise with chrome extensions and I am not particularly expert with javascript.

I'm just following https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted more or less
